chinese_basic_ankideck
======================

This is a clone of the Anki Deck that accompanies the open [basic Chinese language course](http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/opencourseware/cb/chinese_basic.html) by the language centre of the University of Cambridge. 

I have put this on Github for the collaborative finding, tracking, and fixing of typos.

The file is a tab separated text file. Feel free to fork and edit it according to the style guide:
- Every line of the file corresponds to a flash card
- The format of each card/line is *Front <tab> Back*
- The cards allow for basic html commands

I recommend importing the *.txt* into the [desktop version of Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) and then using the synchronization server by Anki to transfer it to mobile devices. 

See also the [documentation](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html) of Anki.

Feel free to raise any issues and pull requests.
